# Netflix-Movie-Data-Analysis
This Python code is a comprehensive implementation of a data analysis project focused on uncovering trends and insights in Netflix movie data. It demonstrates the application of data manipulation and visualization techniques to analyze content trends, genre popularity, and rating distributions. The code emphasizes exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, and creating informative visualizations, showcasing skills essential for data-driven business insights.

# Importing Necessary Libraries

  1. import pandas as pd
  2. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  3. import seaborn as sns
  pandas: Utilized for loading, manipulating, and analyzing data.
  matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating static visualizations like line charts, bar charts, etc.
  seaborn: Built on matplotlib, it simplifies the creation of complex visualizations and provides aesthetically pleasing plots.

# Loading the Dataset

  4. data = pd.read_csv('netflix.csv', engine='python')
  The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named netflix.csv into a DataFrame called data.
  The engine='python' argument is used for compatibility in reading CSV files.

# Inspecting the Dataset

  5. data.head()
  Displays the first five rows, offering an initial glimpse of the data structure and content.

  6. data.tail()
  Shows the last five rows, giving insights into how the dataset concludes.

# Dataset Information:

  7. data.info()
  Provides a detailed summary, including column names, data types, non-null values, and memory usage. This helps in understanding the completeness and structure of the 
  dataset.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Descriptive Statistics:

  8. data.describe()
  Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, min, and max for numerical columns.

# Missing Data Analysis:

  9. data.isnull().sum()
  Checks for missing values across all columns to identify potential data cleaning needs.

# Data Visualization:

# Distribution Plots:

  10. sns.histplot(data['column_name'])
  Visualizes the distribution of a particular numeric column, showing the frequency of different ranges of values.

# Box Plots:

  11. sns.boxplot(x='column_x', y='column_y', data=data)
  Useful for identifying outliers and understanding the spread of the data in different categories.

# Correlation Heatmap:

  12. plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
  13. sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
  Displays the correlation between numerical features in the dataset. The heatmap helps in identifying relationships between variables.

# Insights and Observations
  This code might be aimed at extracting insights such as:
  Which genres are most popular on Netflix.
  The distribution of movie ratings and release years.
  Relationships between movie duration, ratings, and popularity.
